## 🚀 DevOps Engineer | Software Engineer | Cloud & Automation Enthusiast

Hi — I'm **Yanushka Kumar**. I build scalable applications, design production-grade CI/CD pipelines, and automate cloud infrastructure to deliver reliable systems. I enjoy working across the stack: from architecting backends and frontends to deploying and monitoring infrastructure in production.

**Location:** Colombo, Sri Lanka • **Open to** internships & freelance DevOps / SRE work

---

## 🔭 What I do

* Design and implement **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
* Build containerized workloads with **Docker** and orchestrate them with **Kubernetes**
* Provision infrastructure using **Terraform** and manage cloud resources on **AWS** and **GCP**
* Implement monitoring & alerting with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and cloud-native tools
* Develop backend services (Java / Spring Boot, Node.js) and frontend apps (React.js)

## 📦 How to run my demo projects (quick-start)

> Clone the repo you’re interested in and follow the repo README. Example for a React + Node app:

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/YanushkaKumar/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

# run backend
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run   # or `npm install && npm start` for Node-based

# run frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

For Docker/Kubernetes-based repos, check the `/deploy` folder — it contains `Dockerfile`, `k8s` manifests and helm charts (if available).

## 🧭 Tips to make your GitHub profile look like a polished DevOps/SW engineer profile

1. **Pin 6 repos**: CI/CD, Infra (Terraform), one full-stack app, mobile app, monitoring/infra repo, and a small automation script repo.
2. **Keep README.md in each repo** clear with `How to run`, `Architecture`, `CI/CD`, and `Infra` sections.
3. **Use descriptive commit messages** and keep your activity frequent (small meaningful commits).
4. **Add labels and topics** to each repo: `terraform`, `kubernetes`, `devops`, `ci/cd`, `react`, `spring-boot`.
5. **Add screenshots & GIFs** of dashboards, pipeline runs, and app UI in `README.md`.
